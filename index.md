# Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub Page.

### I was introduced to coding well before the first iPhone came out, and I have embraced it ever since.

### My interests lie in applying cutting-edge solutions to solve practical problems.

Coming from an aerospace background, you can see a bunch of cool prior projects that I did, _such as_,

... when I designed [an autonomous multirotor drone,](https://github.com/MNahad/soton-multirotor)

... or when I developed software for [an operational distributed satellite ground station network.](https://github.com/UoS3)

### I'm always into trying out new stuff, and my GitHub repos are a collection of ideas and projects that excite me (and that I'm ok with keeping public ðŸ˜„ ).

In my repos you will find stuff that spans _Computer Vision, ML, Blockchain, IoT, Edge Computing_ ... I'm always working on something different, and my GitHub is one of the places I use to showcase my nice things ðŸ˜ƒ.
