# Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub Page

#### I was introduced to coding well before the first iPhone came out, and I have embraced it ever since.

My interests lie in applying cutting-edge solutions to solve practical problems. Coming from an aerospace background, you can see a bunch of cool prior projects that I did, _such as_ ...

[... when I designed an autonomous multirotor drone ...](https://github.com/MNahad/soton-multirotor)

#### I'm always into trying out new stuff, and my GitHub repos are a collection of ideas and projects that excite me (and that I'm ok with keeping public ðŸ˜„ ).

In my repos you will find stuff that spans _Computer Vision, ML, Blockchain, IoT, Edge Computing_ ... I'm always working on something different, and my GitHub is one of the places I use to showcase my nice things ðŸ˜ƒ .
